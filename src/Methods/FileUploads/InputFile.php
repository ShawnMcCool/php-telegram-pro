/**
 * This object represents the contents of a file to be uploaded. Must be posted using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser.
 *
 * Sending files
 * There are three ways to send files (photos, stickers, audio, media, etc.):
 *
 * - If the file is already stored somewhere on the Telegram servers, you don't need to reupload it: each file object has a file_id field, simply pass this file_id as a parameter instead of uploading. There are no limits for files sent this way.
 * - Provide Telegram with an HTTP URL for the file to be sent. Telegram will download and send the file. 5 MB max size for photos and 20 MB max for other types of content.
 * - Post the file using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser. 10 MB max size for photos, 50 MB for other files.
 *
 * Sending by file_id
 *
 * - It is not possible to change the file type when resending by file_id. I.e. a video can't be sent as a photo, a photo can't be sent as a document, etc.
 * - It is not possible to resend thumbnails.
 * - Resending a photo by file_id will send all of its sizes.
 * - file_id is unique for each individual bot and can't be transferred from one bot to another.
 * - file_id uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have different valid file_ids even for the same bot.
 *
 * Sending by URL
 *
 * - When sending by URL the target file must have the correct MIME type (e.g., audio/mpeg for sendAudio, etc.).
 * - In sendDocument, sending by URL will currently only work for gif, pdf and zip files.
 * - To use sendVoice, the file must have the type audio/ogg and be no more than 1MB in size. 1â€“20MB voice notes will be sent as files.
 * - Other configurations may work but we can't guarantee that they will.
